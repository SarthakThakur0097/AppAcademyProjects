# AppAcademyProjects

This is mono-repository containing most of the projects I completed during my time at AppAcademy (Excluding Gwent)

All of these projects were completed in C#, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, ASP.NET Webforms and primarily ASP.NET MVC

Note: I have not updated the source code for these projects since my graduation from AppAcademy at October 2019
